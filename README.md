# EliteCode - Next.js based scalable online coding platform

- Scalable and Containerized Web Coding Environment: This project aims to create a scalable and containerized web coding platform that enables multiple users to practice and submit code, offering submission history storage and a comprehensive pipeline for code compilation.

- User-Friendly Interface and Coding Experience: The platform leverages modern web technologies such as Monaco (the code editor used in Visual Studio Code) and Next.js to provide an intuitive and familiar coding experience for users, complete with individual user logins. 

- AWS Infrastructure and Serverless Architecture: Code contributions are handled through an AWS infrastructure that utilizes Lambda functions, SQS queues, and Docker containers running on EC2 instances. The results are stored in a PostgreSQL database, allowing users to access and view their submissions seamlessly.
